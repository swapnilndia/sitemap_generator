# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload multiple Excel files simultaneously and process them in batch mode. The system will convert each Excel file to JSON format with the same filename, allow individual or bulk downloads, and provide the ability to generate multiple sitemaps from the converted JSON files. This enhancement significantly improves workflow efficiency for users managing multiple data sources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload multiple Excel files at once, so that I can process large batches of data efficiently without uploading files one by one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user selects multiple Excel files THEN system SHALL accept and display all selected files
2. WHEN user drags and drops multiple files THEN system SHALL process all files in the drop zone
3. WHEN files are selected THEN system SHALL validate each file format and size
4. WHEN invalid files are detected THEN system SHALL show specific error messages for each invalid file
5. WHEN file limit is exceeded THEN system SHALL show warning and allow user to select which files to process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want each Excel file to be converted to JSON with the same filename, so that I can easily identify which JSON corresponds to which original file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Excel file is processed THEN system SHALL create JSON file with same base name
2. WHEN filename conflicts exist THEN system SHALL append unique identifier to prevent overwrites
3. WHEN conversion completes THEN system SHALL maintain original filename structure
4. WHEN file has special characters THEN system SHALL sanitize filename while preserving readability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the progress of batch processing, so that I know which files are being processed and their completion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing starts THEN system SHALL display progress indicator for each file
2. WHEN file processing completes THEN system SHALL update individual file status
3. WHEN errors occur THEN system SHALL show specific error details for failed files
4. WHEN all files complete THEN system SHALL display summary of successful and failed conversions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download individual JSON files or all files as a batch, so that I can choose how to retrieve my converted data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion completes THEN system SHALL provide individual download links for each JSON
2. WHEN user requests batch download THEN system SHALL create ZIP archive with all JSON files
3. WHEN downloading ZIP THEN system SHALL preserve original filenames in archive
4. WHEN download fails THEN system SHALL provide retry mechanism

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate sitemaps from multiple JSON files simultaneously, so that I can create sitemaps for multiple data sources efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user selects multiple JSON files THEN system SHALL allow batch sitemap generation
2. WHEN generating multiple sitemaps THEN system SHALL use consistent configuration across all files
3. WHEN sitemap generation completes THEN system SHALL provide individual sitemap downloads
4. WHEN user requests batch sitemap download THEN system SHALL create ZIP archive with all sitemaps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to apply the same column mapping and URL pattern to all files in a batch, so that I can maintain consistency across multiple data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring batch processing THEN system SHALL allow setting global column mapping
2. WHEN mapping is applied THEN system SHALL use same configuration for all files in batch
3. WHEN files have different column structures THEN system SHALL show warnings for unmappable columns
4. WHEN user wants different configurations THEN system SHALL allow per-file customization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a summary of all processed files and their results, so that I can track the success and failure of my batch operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing completes THEN system SHALL display summary dashboard
2. WHEN viewing summary THEN system SHALL show file count, success rate, and error details
3. WHEN errors exist THEN system SHALL provide actionable error messages and retry options
4. WHEN all successful THEN system SHALL provide quick access to download all results
