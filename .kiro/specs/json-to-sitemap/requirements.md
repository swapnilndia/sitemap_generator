# JSON to Sitemap Converter Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload JSON files (generated from the file-to-json converter or manually created) and convert them into XML sitemap files. The system should support grouping, chunking, and sitemap index generation for large datasets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a JSON file THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON structure
2. WHEN the JSON is valid THEN the system SHALL extract URL data and metadata
3. WHEN the JSON contains grouped data THEN the system SHALL preserve grouping information
4. WHEN the JSON is invalid THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL show a preview of sitemap structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure sitemap generation options, so that I can customize the output format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sitemaps THEN the system SHALL allow setting maximum URLs per file
2. WHEN URLs exceed the limit THEN the system SHALL create multiple sitemap files
3. WHEN multiple files are created THEN the system SHALL generate a sitemap index
4. WHEN grouping is enabled THEN the system SHALL create separate files per group
5. WHEN configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL validate all settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview the sitemap structure, so that I can verify the output before generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preview is requested THEN the system SHALL show sitemap file structure
2. WHEN multiple files will be created THEN the system SHALL list all filenames
3. WHEN grouping is used THEN the system SHALL show URLs per group
4. WHEN preview is satisfactory THEN the system SHALL allow proceeding to generation
5. WHEN changes are needed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration adjustments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate and download sitemap files, so that I can use them for SEO purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation starts THEN the system SHALL create XML sitemap files
2. WHEN multiple files are created THEN the system SHALL package them in a ZIP archive
3. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download links
4. WHEN files are large THEN the system SHALL show progress indication
5. WHEN download is ready THEN the system SHALL allow immediate file access
