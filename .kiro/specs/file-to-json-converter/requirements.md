# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload CSV or Excel files and convert them to JSON format with configurable URL pattern processing, column mapping, and sitemap generation capabilities. The system should provide a user-friendly interface for file upload, configuration, and preview of the conversion results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload CSV or Excel files, so that I can convert my data to JSON format for sitemap generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a CSV or Excel file THEN the system SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a file exceeds 25MB THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN an unsupported file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract and display column headers for mapping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure column mappings and URL patterns, so that I can customize how my data is processed into URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN column headers are extracted THEN the system SHALL display a column mapping interface
2. WHEN a user maps columns THEN the system SHALL validate that required fields are mapped
3. WHEN a user enters a URL pattern THEN the system SHALL validate placeholder syntax
4. WHEN placeholders cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
5. WHEN configuration is valid THEN the system SHALL enable the conversion process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview the conversion results, so that I can verify the output before processing the entire file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a preview of sample URLs
2. WHEN preview is generated THEN the system SHALL display first 5 sample URLs with their source row data
3. WHEN there are exclusions THEN the system SHALL show exclusion reasons
4. WHEN preview looks correct THEN the system SHALL allow proceeding with full conversion
5. WHEN user requests changes THEN the system SHALL allow modifying configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert my file to JSON format, so that I can download the processed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates conversion THEN the system SHALL process all rows in the file
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive JSON output
3. WHEN JSON is generated THEN the system SHALL include metadata, statistics, and processed data
4. WHEN conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL provide download options
5. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure optional sitemap settings, so that I can include lastmod dates, changefreq, and priority values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring conversion THEN the system SHALL provide optional sitemap settings
2. WHEN lastmod is enabled THEN the system SHALL validate date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. WHEN changefreq is specified THEN the system SHALL validate against allowed values
4. WHEN priority is specified THEN the system SHALL validate range (0.0-1.0)
5. WHEN grouping is enabled THEN the system SHALL organize URLs by specified column values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see processing statistics and error reports, so that I can understand what happened during conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion completes THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive statistics
2. WHEN there are excluded rows THEN the system SHALL provide detailed exclusion reasons
3. WHEN there are duplicate URLs THEN the system SHALL report duplicate count and examples
4. WHEN there are invalid dates THEN the system SHALL list invalid lastmod values
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL display actionable error messages
